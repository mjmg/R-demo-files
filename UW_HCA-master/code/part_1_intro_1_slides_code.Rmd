## Why R?
<div class="columns-2">

Data Smart is a great book for learning how to do machine learning in Excel.

<br/>
But... what it takes a ~50 page chapter on forecasting in Excel to accomplish can be done in R with 1 line of code: ```forecast(my_time_series)```

## It's true: learning R is a pain in the ass

While the learning curve is steep,    
it **is** easy to "learn to use R to accomplish *x*"...

While the learning curve is steep,   
it **is** easy to "learn to use R to accomplish *x*"...  
especially if you're willing to just be a hacker.

## The hacker's motto

**F\*#k with it until it works or breaks.**

## You might think this slide deck is pointless

and it pretty much is. 


## But it was created *entirely* in R

```{r intslide, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(qcc)
require(dygraphs)

bsi = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rmadillo/UW_HCA/master/data/clabsi.csv", header=T)

bsi$Month = paste(bsi$Month, "01", sep="-")

bsi$Month = as.Date(bsi$Month)

bsi$Rate = round( ((bsi$BSI / bsi$central_line_days) * 1000), 1)

bob = qcc(bsi$BSI, sizes = bsi$central_line_days/1000, type = "u", nsigmas = 2, plot=FALSE)

bsi = data.frame(bsi, bob$limits)

bsi_base = bsi[,4:6]
  
bsi_ts = ts(bsi_base, start = c(1998, 1), frequency = 12)

dygraph(bsi_ts, main = "Monthly CLA-BSI Rate Control Chart") %>%
  dyRangeSelector()
```

## Outline for tonight and next week
<br/>

1. Intro to RStudio via storytelling and interactive vizualization  
2. The analytics process in R: *Are CLA-BSIs increasing?* 
<br/>
  
3. Pattern evaluation with dimension reduction  
4. Evaluating predictive models
