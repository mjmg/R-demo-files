# If you want your slides to adapt to any changes in the data
# all your analysis should occur before the slides start.
# Then, you can use R objects to place soft values in the text.

# Use code chunks like this to place figures
# or use `r R_OBJECT$piece_of_object` to place object or object pieces inline

speed_stats = mean(cars$speed)

```


## Recommendations and/or Summary

- No more than about 4 *major* points or so
- Give the decision make the answer **first**
- and leave the details to further on in the report
- Average speed was `r speed_stats`  


## Car go fast.
```{r plot1}
ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```


## Car go fast without code.
```{r plot2, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

## Car go fast interactively.
```{r plot3, echo=FALSE}
tauchart(cars) %>%
  tau_point("speed", "dist") %>%
  tau_trendline() %>%
  tau_tooltip()
```


## Model cars.
```{r model}
summary(lm(cars$dist ~ cars$speed))
```
