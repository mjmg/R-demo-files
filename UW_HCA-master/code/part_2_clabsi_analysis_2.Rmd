## Recent CLA-BSI rates remain within normal natural variation. 
 
<br/> 
 
#### Summary
 
<br/> 
 
- A clear step-change decline in mean monthly CLA-BSI rates occurred around September 2001.
 
- There is no evidence that monthly CLA-BSI rates have gone out of control (i.e., no departures from natural variation) since September 2001.
 
- 2006 had the lowest rate of any annual span in this time series, and is something of an outlier at this level of aggregation. 
 
- Greater detail on recent CLA-BSI events, including Unit-level information, is available from the [All Knowing Greatness that is Google](http://www.google.com/).

**Changepoint analysis of the CLA-BSI time series shows a change in mean rate around September 2001, declining by `r txtRound(vm1$coefficients[2], 1)` CLA-BSIs per 1,000 central line days (Figure 2).** 
 
 
 
- Changepoint analysis determined that the optimal model includes two segments, with a changepoint at September 2001 (95% CI: Nov 2000, Feb 2003). 
 
- Mean CLA-BSI rate for segment 1 is `r txtRound(vm1$coefficients[1], 1)` and the mean CLA-BSI rate for segment 2 is `r txtRound( vm1$coefficients[1] + vm1$coefficients[2], 1)`. 
 
- The change in mean CLA-BSI rate between these two segments is `r txtRound(vm1$coefficients[2], 1)`.

**Control chart of monthly CLA-BSI rates since the last changepoint shows no recent out-of-control months (Figure 3).** 
 
- Because there is no evidence of a trend or  autocorrelation, a control chart is suitable for evaluating the statistical process since the changepoint. A 2&sigma; control limit is used to be conservative (i.e., willing to accept more false positives).  
 
- The only out-of-control point occurred in Septemeber 2001. This would be expected natural variation in a time series of >20 points.
 
- Monthly CLA-BSI rates since the changepoint show no evidence of changes inconsistent with natural variation.

#### Methods
 
- Analysis was performed in R. 
 
- Data was derived from the ```MEGA TABLE OF DOOM``` and ```Some_Excel_sheet_I_found_laying_around_in_Starbucks.xlxs``` tables in the Data Warehouse on Server 42.    
 
- Changepoint detection was done using the ```breakpoints``` function in the ```strucchange``` package, using the default parameter values (```h=0.15, breaks=5```). A deeper analysis might consider a sensitivity analysis of changepoint detection using ```h=3``` and ```h=12``` to explore how typical evaluation and planning cycles (i.e., quarterly, annually) used as minimum segment lengths might impact the statistical results, and thus inferences made against those results. In addition, other packages such as ```bcp``` and ```changepoint``` might be used to see if changepoint detection locations are similar across each package's algorithms and methodologies.  
 
- Information-theoretic (IT) methods with BIC were used to simultaneously test multiple hypotheses (changepoint models). The results are as follows:     
 
```{r bictab, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
htmlTable(txtRound(BICtable, 2), align="r",
          header = c(" BIC ", " &Delta;BIC ", " Log-Likelihood ", " P<sub>M|D</sub>* "),
          rnames = c("0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "lm"),
          rowlabel = "Model/Changepoints",
           tfoot="*Probability of the model, given the data (aka Model Weights).",
          css.cell = "padding-left: 2em; padding-right: 1em;")
```
 
- Raw output from the changepoint analysis: 
 
```{r bpsummary, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
clabsi_bp_summary
clabsi_bp_confint
